This is a Haskell implementation of [famous game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/287980/Mini_Metro/) developed as a course project at Innopolis University. 


## How to run the game

1. Type in the home directory 
    ```
    stack run
    ```  
2. Then open your browser at http://localhost:3000/

## How to play

To begin placing a new route click on any of the colored circle below (representation of the metro lines) and then choose which station you would like to connect.

To place a locomotive on one of the line click of the train icon and then on the line you want it to be placed at.

## Possbile improvements

1. Better UI
2. Improved drawing of the game (e.g. lines, icons, train)
3. Imrpoved UX (drag and drop feature for trains and lines)
4. Better animations (new stations appearing, train moving, a lot of passengers on the line, game over)
5. Better map (less stations at the start, they appear at random as time goes by, more passengers types)
6. Additional gameplay features (rivers and bridges, faster trains type, interchanges - bigger stations)
7. Pause/Increased speed control
8. 'Phantom lines'
